This is a repository for collecting useful notebooks related to `ADEPT` (https://github.com/ergodicio/adept). You can use the code provided in these notebooks to access and visualize the simulation results. If there are any specific requests for code or physics, please file an issue :)

### List of examples
#### Vlasov
- Two-stream instability 
- Bump-on-tail instability
- Strong Landau damping (large amplitude electron plasma wave)

#### Enveloped 3-wave equations
- Two Plasmon Decay Instability 

#### Vlasov-Fokker-Planck (thermal transport)
- Laser hotspot relaxation and non-local heat flow
